# Basic Informational Site

## Project Overview

This is a simple informational website built using **Node.js**. The site contains 4 basic pages:

- **index.html** (Homepage)
- **about.html** (About page)
- **contact-me.html** (Contact page)
- **404.html** (Error page for unrecognized routes)

The primary goal of this project is to practice creating a Node.js server and handling routes for a basic website.

## Project Details

In this course, you’ll build a basic website with four pages. The pages are static HTML, and we focus primarily on setting up the Node.js server to serve these pages based on the URL requested by the user.

### Routes:

- **localhost:8080** → Displays `index.html`
- **localhost:8080/about** → Displays `about.html`
- **localhost:8080/contact-me** → Displays `contact-me.html`
- Any other URL → Displays `404.html`

## Files You’ll Create

You will create the following files in your project directory:

- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `contact-me.html`
- `404.html`
- `index.js` (Node.js server file)

## How to Set Up the Project

1. **Create the project folder** and navigate to it. Then run `node index.js`.
